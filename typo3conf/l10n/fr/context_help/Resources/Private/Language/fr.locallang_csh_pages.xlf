				<source>An abstract is a short description of the page content that might be a little longer than the one in the &lt;i&gt;Description&lt;/i&gt; field.

Unlike the description, the abstract is not meant for display in search engine result lists, but is instead intended for you own use.

If you create a Content Element of type &lt;i&gt;Sitemap&lt;/i&gt; and then choose &lt;i&gt;Menu of subpages to these pages (with abstract)&lt;/i&gt; an overview of pages will be created. If an abstract is available for a page it will be used instead of the description.

&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; You do not have to enter the text of the description into the &lt;i&gt;Abstract field&lt;/i&gt; again.

Admins can also make custom use of this field via their TypoScript templates.</source>

				<source>A URL Alias is a unique identification string for a page. You can use this string instead of the ID number to refer to the page.</source>
				<target state="translated">Un Alias d'URL est un chaine d'identification unique pour une page. Vous pouvez utiliser cette chaine au lieu du numéro pour se référer à la page.</target>

			<trans-unit id="alias.details" xml:space="preserve" approved="yes">
				<source>Ultimately a page is identified by its ID number. For example, you may access a page in TYPO3 at '.../?id=123'. If the page with ID '123' has the URL Alias 'one_two_three', then the URL '.../?id=one_two_three' would display exactly the same page, because 'one_two_three' is a URL Alias for the ID '123'.
URL Aliases are normally assigned to only the most frequently used pages rather than all pages. In most TYPO3 configurations you would be able to use the syntax '.. &amp;lt;link one_two_three&amp;gt;go to the page&amp;lt;/link&amp;gt; ..' to create a link to the page. This is easier to remember.
Another use is if you need to change which page a commonly used link points to. In this case you can delete the URL Alias for the original page and re-add it on the new page. All links using the URL Alias would now refer to the new page and its ID number.</source>
			<target state="translated">En fin de compte, une page est identifée par son numéro ID. Par exemple, vous pouvez accéder à une page en TYPO3 par ".../?id=123". Si la page avec l'ID "123" a l'alias d'URL "un_deux_trois", alors l'URL ".../id=un_deux_trois" restituerait exactement la même page, parce que "un_deux_trois" est un alias d'URL pour l'ID "123".Les alias d'URL sont normalement assignés uniquement aux pages les plus fréquentées plutôt qu'à toutes les pages. Dans la plupart des configurations TYPO3, vous serez en mesure d'utiliser la syntaxe '.. &amp;lt;link un_deux_trois&amp;gt;go to the page&amp;lt;/link&amp;gt; ..' pour créer un lien vers cette page. Cela est plus facile à retenir.Une autre de ses utilisations est lorsque vous voulez changer la page qu'un lien communément utilisé pointe. Dans ce cas, vous pouvez supprimer l'alias d'URL de la page d'origine et l'ajouter à nouveau sur la nouvelle page. Tous les liens utilisant l'alias d'URL se référeront désormais à cette nouvelle page et son numéro ID.</target></trans-unit>

'Shortcut' pages jump to another page in the Pagetree.
'Mount Point' pages bring content from another branch of the Pagetree into the current branch.

'Recycler' is a garbage can. Pages and records in the Recycler are not visible in the Frontend.

Note that search engine extensions for TYPO3 such as Indexed Search can also be configured to make use of the keywords.

Setting an integer value at the beginning of the field sets it as the default type for the page.
For example, if an RSS feed is configured in TypoScript as typeNum=100, setting the Link Target to 100 could be used to add an RSS link in the menu.

The following syntax is used to open the page in a popup window:
400x200 - Opens the page in a 400x200 popup window.
230x450:resizable=0,location=1 - Opens the page in a 230x450 popup window that is not resizable and has an address bar.
